#### WEB PAYMENTS API SUPPORT
Payje for WooCommerce includes Web Payments API support, allowing customers to pay using payment information associated with their mobile devices in browsers that support the Web Payments API (Chrome for Android, amongst others). On mobile, checkout is now just a few taps away.

#### PAYJE API SYNC
Payje introduces a new way to integrate our platform with your stores in less than 1 min. You no longer have to worry about where to get the API Access Key or API Signature Key from the payment platform. We have you covered! 

The new technology helps non-technical or first time users to integrate with our payment platform with your login details only. We help to fetch the API keys automatically and you just have to install our plugin. It is that simple! [Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mhcNP-xKWg)
